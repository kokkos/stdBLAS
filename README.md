# P1673 reference implementation

This is a reference implementation of P1673,
"A free function linear algebra interface based on the BLAS."
You can find the latest submitted revision of P1673
[at this URL](https://wg21.link/p1673).

## Requirements

  - CMake >= 3.17 (earlier versions may work, but are not tested)
  - C++ build environment that supports C++17 or greater

## Tested compilers

We run github's automated tests on every pull request.
Automated tests use "ubuntu-latest",
which presumably defaults to a fairly new GCC.
Other compilers, including MSVC 2019, have been tested in the past.

## Brief build instructions

1. Download and install googletest (GTest)
   - https://github.com/google/googletest
2. Download and install mdspan:
   - git@github.com:kokkos/mdspan.git
3. Run CMake, pointing it to your googletest and mdspan install locations
   - If you want to build tests, set LINALG_ENABLE_TESTS=ON
   - If you want to build examples, set LINALG_ENABLE_EXAMPLES=ON
   - If you have a BLAS installation, set LINALG_ENABLE_BLAS=ON.
     BLAS support is currently experimental.
   - If you have a TBB (Threading Building Blocks) installation
     and want to use TBB, set LINALG_ENABLE_TBB=ON (and optionally
     set TBB_DIR to the lib/cmake/TBB subdirectory of your TBB installation,
     or wherever the TBBConfig.cmake file happens to live).
     TBB support is currently experimental.
4. Build and install as usual
5. If you enabled tests, use "ctest" to run them

## More detailed MSVC build instructions

Be sure to build mdspan and googletest in the Release configuration before installing.

The following CMake options are known to work:

- mdspan_DIR=${MDSPAN_INSTALL_DIR}\lib\cmake\mdspan
  (where MDSPAN_INSTALL_DIR is the path to your mdspan installation)
- GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR=${GTEST_INSTALL_DIR}\include
  (where GTEST_INSTALL_DIR is the path to your googletest installation)
- GTEST_LIBRARY=${GTEST_INSTALL_DIR}\lib\gtest.lib
- GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY=${GTEST_INSTALL_DIR}\lib\gtest_main.lib

When building tests, for all CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_* options,
you might need to change "/MD" to "/MT", depending on how googletest was built.
